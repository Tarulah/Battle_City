This was my first ever game in Unity (C#). There was both a single and multiplayer campaign in it. 
There were 4 programmers doing the single player version in which one also did the art. 
Only 3 programmers were left when we started the multiplayer campaign. 
For the single player campaign I did the shooting mechanism, the destruction of objects when shot at and some map construction. 
The single player version was done in 8 weeks. The multiplayer version was done using Photon Engine. 
I did about a half of the stuff neede for the multiplayer to work.
Here is how it looked: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjeN35Voqwk
